# Project Pizza

I got to do use JS variables, conditionals, and native methods.

## The problem

I thought about the what we learn by ourselves and with Diego, I looked att the booking tyckets for the concert code and try to understand it and apply it to my project, I tried to keep it simple so I could finish the project, I use google and ChatGPT to understand some of the steps I couldn't do by my self.
